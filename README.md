# 🧠 Superstore Sales Analysis – Excel Dashboard


## 📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data from the **Sample Superstore** dataset to extract actionable business insights and identify **market expansion opportunities**.
The project was developed during my **Data Analysis training at NTI**, using **Excel** for data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard design.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The main goal was not just to visualize data — but to understand the business side and answer real questions such as:

* Which **products** perform best (and worst) in terms of profit and discount rates?
* Which **states/regions** generate the highest returns?
* How do **seasonal trends** (by quarter) affect sales and profit?
* What are the best opportunities for **market and product expansion**?
